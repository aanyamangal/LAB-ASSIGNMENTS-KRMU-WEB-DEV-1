1. Project Theme


Example:
Theme Chosen: Food Delivery Website
This project is a fully responsive static website featuring a landing page with course cards, testimonials, pricing plans, and a contact form.

2. Project Description

This project demonstrates a complete responsive website built using semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid). The goal is to design and structure a real-world user interface that works smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The site contains a hero banner, multiple structured content sections, navigation, cards, media elements, and a working (non-functional) form. Visual polish is added using custom colors, fonts, spacing, and hover effects.
